## Abstract {.page_break_before}

## Importance


## Introduction {.page_break_before}

### High-level/general background about GitHub
*contributors to this section: RCO,*  

With over 73 million registered users, GitHub and its underlying version control system Git, are the defacto platform for collaboration on computer code [@https://github.com/about]. 
GitHub has become an indispensible tool for software developers because,through version control, users can track changes to multiple files and folders over time [@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928]. 
Thus, users have an "audit trail" on the files they choose to store on their GitHub repositroies which simultanously less "ad hoc" than passing files back and forth yet able to scale up as projects take on more files or collaborators [@doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7].
Researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology (EEB) are starting to collaborate on software as part of their research, and many are interacting with GitHub for the first time. 
For some first-time users, the GitHub learning curve can seem overwhelming because the platform and its features were created with collaboration on software as the central goal.  
However, by leveraging existing tools on GitHub and the wide range of collaborations they can enable, researchers in EEB can make the most out of their research and collaborative projects.

### What's already been written about GitHub
*contributors to this section:* 
There’s lots of detailed info in other papers about version control. Much less about using it as a tool for **collaboration**!
We'll avoid going into the underlying version control language (called git) since that discussion can get very technical very quick, and there are already many papers (Blischak et al. 2016; Perez-Riverol, 2016), books (Bryan 2018), tutorials go into that. More importantly, the GitHub platform is so robust at this point, that you can take advantage of many collaborative aspects without knowing even a line of Git code.

### What's already been done with GitHub in EcoEvo
*contributors to this section:* 
Very friendly description of what GitHub is and the main uses and advantages of using it in the natural sciences back in 2016 (Perkel 2016)
What's missing about GitHub in EcoEvo and our objective: Introducing the GitHub ecosystem that's composed of many different elements!

### What's missing about GitHub in EcoEvo and our objective
*contributors to this section:* 
Simple habits (of which github is one component) can do a lot to make research more reproducible and collaborative (Alston and Rick 2021).
In EcoEvo Github use is predicated on an understanding in R. 
This close connection has some benefits, but other programming languages are frequently used by researchers (e.g. Python, Julia). 
Lots of ways to use GitHub that are independent from R. 
We have in this hackathon a definite focus on R tools for interacting with GitHub, but sometimes the issues we present at 'Github' issues might be more about the ways that we interact with Github (i.e. through R vs. bash shell)

## GitHub in EcoEvo examples (Part 1)

### Storing and archiving version-controlled data
*contributors to this section:* 
Another potential use case/user perspective: Some people are just using GitHub to  backup their data, use their code on differnt machines. Just push and pull (Box 1) from their own repo. 
GitHub integrates with Zenodo, a popular, free data archiving service funded by CERN. After linking your GitHub account to Zenodo and turning on archiving, any time a release (Box 1) is made, a snapshot of the entire repository is archived in Zenodo with a versioned, citable DOI

### Virtual lab notebook
*contributors to this section:*
commits as a way to record daily progress
issues as a way to keep track of short-term objectives/goals, and progress towards them

### Responding to reviewer comments
*contributors to this section:*
using github issues (Box 1) to organize and respond to reviewer comments on a manuscript. See example [here](https://github.com/BrunaLab/HeliconiaDemography/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22reviewer+comment%22+)

### Classroom teaching / educational materials
*contributors to this section:*
Matthew D. Beckman, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, Nicholas J. Horton, Colin W. Rundel, Adam J. Sullivan & Maria Tackett (2021) Implementing Version Control With Git and GitHub as a Learning Objective in Statistics and Data Science Courses, Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education, 29:sup1, S132-S144, DOI: 10.1080/10691898.2020.1848485



## GitHub in EcoEvo examples (Part 2)

### Project management
*Contributors to this section:* Kaitlyn Gaynor

GitHub can be a powerful tool for team-based project management, allowing collaborators to share feedback, brainstorm ideas, and troubleshoot problems. The "Issues" feature of GitHub allows for discrete tasks and sub-tasks to be identified, assigned to team members, and categorized with custom labels, and the new "Discussion" feature serves as a message board for conversation. Scripts and commit messages can be linked directly to issues and discussions, providing a clear record of project workflow. The use of GitHub for all project-related conversation and planning, rather than e-mail or messaging tools, makes it easier to keep track of progress throughout the lifespan of a project and less likely for issues to slip through the cracks. It is not essential for all team members to have proficiency in git or programming, as users can interact with Issues and Discussions via web browser or e-mail. 

Can talk about ESS-DIVE's project management using ZenHub/Jira

### Building website
*Contributors to this section:*
Seems like the technical aspect of this is discussed in Dawson, Chris (2016). Building Tools with GitHub: Customize Your Workflow. O'Reilly Media
GitHub pages allows any .html document to be rendered as a website with a URL. 
This could be, for example, a report written in markdown or R Markdown rendered into a .html file.

### Making code citable
*Contributors to this section:*
Linking with Zenodo, etc. to achieve a DOI helps work become findable, gives proper attribution (Hampton et al. 2015)
It is important to remember that GitHub is NOT a long-term data/code repository by itself (accounts can be deleted at will), so adding GitHub links in papers (which I've seen plenty of times), is not a good practice (imo). Instead, including a DOI (like above bullet) is better.

### Collaborative (code) editing
*Contributors to this section:* Kaitlyn Gaynor

From its inception, one of the primary uses of GitHub has been for collaborative coding.

Is it worth walking through how collaborative code editing works through GitHub, or just pointing to all the available resources for this? (e.g. https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request)

GitHub can facilitate interactions between research advisors and advisees, providing a platform for students or other trainees to share in-progress code, and flag specific challenges or questions for their supervisors or mentors. Periodic code review can also help advisors to identify errors early in the process, and inform further training and mentorship to fill gaps in skills. 

### Writing manuscript
*contributors to this section:*
Caveat that GitHub has been called out for not being so user-friendly for manuscript development (Ram 2013). But getting better?
Tools that link with GitHub have been developed with synchronous writing in mind. HackMD provides a collaborative writing platform based on Markdown that integrates with GitHub.  
We used this platform early on in the process of writing this manuscript to generate an outline.


## GitHub in EcoEvo examples (Part 3)

### Open science discussion
*Contributors to this section:*
https://github.community/
GitHub new discussion tool

### Project continuity
*Contributors to this section:*
'thus preserving the long-term integrity of the project even as collaborations form and shift.’ (Hampton et al. 2015) 
better to have old versions on GitHub than on somebody's personal hard drive! 

### Asycnhronous working
*Contributors to this section:*

### GitHub organizations
*Contributors to this section:*
Lab organization as a place to house research compendia as well as codes of conduct, protocols, training documents, etc. (documents that evolve over time and are shaped collaboratively)
Students can have full ownership over repositories in organization, but stay with the lab after they've left.

### Misc other uses
*Contributors to this section:*
Developing data standards - This is pretty specific case from our team at Berkeley Lab, so I can write about it in a sentence or two here.
Code review rOpenSci's code review process, and also caught mistakes in code of published papers that could have been caught in peer code review.  Also maybe say something about ReproHack.

## Discussion

### General pargrah on what GitHub can enable in EcoEvo
General paragraph on GitHub on how, given all the potential uses of GitHub, it can enable more collaborative EcoEvo research
Despite all the awesomeness of GitHub, there are still plenty of times when you might look to other plantforms for collaboration

### Why aren't more people using GitHub?
Learning to use Github requires time, but the payoff is *[may be?]* worth it.
Time vs. effort examples or analyses to demonstrate the payoff can help drive the point home to convince people to learn these tools

### Limitations
Our own limitations since we are mostly writing from the EcoEvo perspective/ additional github limitation
Reliance on R since we are generally in EcoEvo
Discussion of free vs. paid plans. When projects get highly collaborative may have to add / pay for accounts. At this point, little difference between paid and free.

### Using GitHub is a good start, but lots of practices to make repo more user friendly
end off with our 5/10 tips for how to gain knowledge/practice with GitHub here
