## Abstract {.page_break_before}

## Importance


## Introduction {.page_break_before}

### High-level/general background about GitHub
*Contributors to this section: RCO, SSHS .*  

With over 73 million registered users, GitHub and its underlying version control system Git, are the _de facto_ platform for collaboration on computer code [@https://github.com/about]. 
GitHub has become an indispensable tool for software developers because, through version control, users can track changes to multiple files and folders over time [@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928]. 
Thus, users have an "audit trail" on the files they choose to store on their GitHub repositories which simultaneously less _ad hoc_ than passing files back and forth yet able to scale up as projects take on more files or collaborators [@doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7].
GitHub as useful software and code repository service can broadly facilitate openly available source code alongside concomitant collaborative development. [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947]

Researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology (EEB) are starting to collaborate on software as part of their research, and some are interacting with GitHub for the first time [@doi:10.1038/s41559-017-0160]. 
For first-time users, the GitHub learning curve can seem overwhelming because the creation of the platform and its features were initially centred in collaboration for software development [CITE].
However, by leveraging existing tools on GitHub and the wide range of collaborations they can enable, researchers in EEB can make the most out of their research and collaborative projects.

### What's already been written about GitHub

*Contributors to this section: RCO, PHPB.* 

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the version control system that enables all the collaborative tools available on GitHub.
In Git, changes performed to files are registered as uniquely identified "commits", which are a snapshot of the line-by-line changes that have been voluntarily performed at that moment.
Because the details of interacting with Git can get very technical very quick, we focus instead on the web platform GitHub.
However, we suggest those interested in Git explore the many papers [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668] [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947] and books [@https://happygitwithr.com/] that can provide an introduction to git.
Despite the prevelance of technical papers and books that focus on Git or GitHub for the software development community, there are much fewer resources for EEB researchers who want to begin collaborating through GitHub.
We acknowledge that GitHub is not the only way for productive collaboration on cloud-based research documents and code, so we encourage researchers in EEB to take the elements of a GitHub that fit into their workflow.
Because GitHub as web platform is so well documented and has a robust user community, scientists can take advantage of many collaborative aspects without knowing even a line of Git code.

### What's already been done with GitHub in EcoEvo
*Contributors to this section:*  

Very friendly description of what GitHub is and the main uses and advantages of using it in the natural sciences back in 2016 (Perkel 2016).
What's missing about GitHub in EcoEvo and our objective: Introducing the GitHub ecosystem that's composed of many different elements!

### What's missing about GitHub in EcoEvo and our objective
*Contributors to this section:*  

Simple habits (of which github is one component) can do a lot to make research more reproducible and collaborative (Alston and Rick 2021).
In EcoEvo Github use is predicated on an understanding in R. 
This close connection has some benefits, but other programming languages are frequently used by researchers (e.g. Python, Julia). 
Lots of ways to use GitHub that are independent from R. 
We have in this hackathon a definite focus on R tools for interacting with GitHub, but sometimes the issues we present at 'Github' issues might be more about the ways that we interact with Github (i.e. through R vs. bash shell)

I am just testing what happens if I add a sentence. (Saeed) :) 
It is also important to consider what are the aims of researchers and how they want contribute in...

### Box 1: Definitions
<!-- Contributors to this section: ERS, Ali -->
<!--# I thought it might be helpful to have a box with short definitions of git/GitHub terminology used in the manuscript. If any of these are discussed more in depth in the main text, they may not need to be here. -->

-   **repository**:

-   **commit**: Commits are like snapshots in the development of a project.
    Commits can include changes in multiple files and must include a brief commit message describing the changes made.
    A typical workflow is to make some related changes in files, make a commit (e.g. "generate and include fig1 in results"), and after several commits to **push** those commits to the remote GitHub **repository**.

-   clone: Cloning a **repository** is a way of making a local copy (i.e. on your computer) of a GitHub **repository**.
    If you have access to **push** to a **repository**, this can be a first step to contributing to a project.

-   branch: Development branches can be created at any point in time and work on each branch can continue independently.
    This is useful for testing out new ideas (both code and text) which may or may not eventually get integrated into the main branch of the project.
    Branches can also be used to isolate contributions of multiple contributors.
    Each person working on their own branch eliminates problems that arise when conflicting edits are pushed to the same branch.
    Changes in a development branch can be merged into the main branch via **pull requests**.
    Branches can only be made by those who are given access to the project **repository**.

-   fork: A fork is a copy of a **repository** hosted on GitHub.
    If a repository is public, then anyone can make a fork.
    Even if they do not have access to push to the original repository, they can make a fork and edit it independently.
    Forks are linked to the original GitHub repository and "upstream" changes (those in the original repository) can be merged to keep the fork up to date with the original project.
    Changes made in the fork can be integrated into the original project via **pull requests**.

-   push/pull: When **commits** are made in a project locally, they must be synced with the remote GitHub repository by "**pushing**" them.
    Changes on a GitHub repository can then be "**pulled**" to keep your local version of the project up to date.

-   pull request: A pull request is a request that the owner of a GitHub repository integrate changes you've made on either a **branch** in the repository or in your own **fork**.
    When you initiate a pull request, you must provide a description of what changes are made.
    Some automated tests may be run and review may be required before integrating your changes.

-  merge:

-  status: Checking the status of the  projects

-  init: Initializing a new git database

-  log: Check the history of the project

### Storing and archiving version-controlled data
*contributors to this section: Dylan Gomes*

Many researchers often start their use of GitHub to backup their working data and code to a remote server (Just push and pull, see Box 1, from their own repo). 
This saves the user time from backing up data and code on their own portable devices, such as hard drives. 
This also offers some peace of mind, as this information is retrievable even if one's laptop ends up at the bottom of a lake. 
Thus, an additional benefit of this 'cloud' storage is that one's GitHub repository can be accessed by any machine with internet access, allowing the user to be more mobile if they wish to both work from home and the office from different computers. 
Each time a user pushes changes to their repository, GitHub tracks what these changes are and stores this history. 
This feature allows for version control, such that users can re-visit previous versions of data and code. 
This is particularly useful if a mistake has been made where a user has unknowingly overwritten or deleted information that would otherwise be irretrievable without GitHub having saved that information.

GitHub also integrates with Zenodo, a free, long-term data archiving service funded by CERN. After linking your GitHub account to Zenodo and turning on archiving, any time a release (Box 1) is made, a snapshot of the entire repository is archived in Zenodo with a versioned, citable DOI (see `### Making code citable` below for more information).

### Virtual lab notebook

commits as a way to record daily progress
issues as a way to keep track of short-term objectives/goals, and progress towards them



### Classroom teaching / educational materials
*contributors to this section: Cole Brookson*

GitHub provides a large variety of uses for hosting teaching/educational materials. 
In fact, through taking advantage of the suite of GitHub features, the entire process of running a course, workshop, or even just a lecture, can all be done openly on GitHub. 
As a matter of gross simplification, organizing a course (for example) could be broken down into: 1) developing the material (i.e. slides, examples, relevant readings, labs, etc.), 2) hosting the course on some online platform for students to access, 3) delivering the content, and 4) dealing with student submissions and the subsequent grade returns.
While of course there are other purpose-built platforms for this type of activity, few of them provide the usability at the price point GitHub does. 
First, developing your course material, from slides to labs and everything in between, can be done on GitHub, out in the open, where others can see, review and offer feedback on your process! 
Making presentations can be done through most major high-level programming languages such as [R, with `RMarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-11.html), [Python, with `python-ppt`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), and [Julia, with `Remark.jl`](https://juliapackages.com/p/remark).
Since all these programs work via code bases, they can be version-controlled through git and GitHub.
Once you've made all the content for your course, hosting a course website can be done through GitHub pages, and there are [lots of templates available](https://github.com/topics/course-website) to borrow from.
This way, not only can the course content be available to your enrolled students, but also to anyone interested in the course material.
Since the course material can be easily housed on a GitHub pages website, it is then simple enough to deliver the content via that website, and/or a GitHub organization with template repositories for assignments etc.
Student submissions are perhaps the least seamless component, but for assignments submitted as code files (i.e. `.R` & `.Rmd` as two of the most common) and/or `.pdf` files, GitHub has a new and far-from-perfect but still useful tool [GitHub classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) where instructors can host private assignments, and even build custom autograding tests, that will autograde assignments!
 
The previous section is meant to highlight the myriad tools GitHub can provide to centralize the delivery of educational materials.
While most instructors will likely choose to pick from this selection and end up having a mix of tools to deliver their content to students, it is still valuable to utilize some of these, if only for the reason that it can encourage students to even *begin* learning about version control through interacting with git/GitHub, however minimally, through the course.
There are (as always) no "points" awarded for using ALL GitHub materials ALL the time, but if a central tenant of a given course or educational unit is to introduce or give students experience to version control and the tools that working professionals in the biological sciences use, then adopting a few of these tools can be a great way to do so.

### Project management

*Contributors to this section:* Kaitlyn Gaynor, Rob Crystal-Ornelas

GitHub can be a powerful tool for team-based project management, allowing collaborators to share feedback, brainstorm ideas, and troubleshoot problems.
The "Issues" feature of GitHub allows for discrete tasks and sub-tasks to be identified, assigned to team members, and categorized with custom labels, and the new "Discussion" feature serves as a message board for conversation.
Scripts, commit messages, and pull requests can be linked directly to issues and discussions, providing a clear record of project workflow.
The use of GitHub for all project-related conversation and planning, rather than e-mail or messaging tools, makes it easier to keep track of progress throughout the lifespan of a project and less likely for issues to slip through the cracks.
It is not essential for all team members to have proficiency in git or programming, as users can interact with Issues and Discussions via web browser or e-mail.
GitHub can also be integrated with other project management software like Slack or Zenhub.

By default, GitHub repositories are publicly visible, and so anyone with a GitHub account can not only view content, but also engage with repository administrators through Issues and Discussions.

Can talk about ESS-DIVE's project management using ZenHub/Jira to manage customer support requests, feature updates to our data sharing platform.

### Building website

*Contributors to this section: Rob Crystal-Ornelas, Emma Hudgins*   
It is now common for many scientists to have personal, project, or lab websites (hereafter, personal websites) to share and promote their work.  
There are many options for creating and hosting websites.  
Some sites are built through a point-and-click user interface that requires no coding experience, but these services tend to have monthly or annual fees (e.g., Wix, Squarespace, Wordpress).  
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allows users with a GitHub account to easily create a website, hosted by GitHub, from one of their many website templates [@doi:10.1038/538127a].  
When creating a website with GitHub Pages, all content is stored in a GitHub repository, the documents are written in markdown (e.g., https://github.com/SORTEE-Github-Hackathon/main-website), and a website is automatically rendered in HTML from the markdown documents (e.g., https://sortee-github-hackathon.github.io/main-website/).  
Aside from free hosting services, another benefit is that GitHub pages are autogenerated, meaning that when content is modified in the associated GitHub repository, the website instantly updates [@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928].  
Though the templates are useful for relatively quickly starting up a new website, users are able to fully customize their Pages websites (for technical details of customizing GitHub Pages site see Dawson and Straub, 2016).  
We emphasize that despite the many benefits of using GitHub pages (free hosting, templates, customization), this avenue for creating a website will be more time intensive than the out of the box platforms mentioned above and requires consideration of tradeoffs offered by website creation services.

Seems like the technical aspect of this is discussed in Dawson, Chris (2016).

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) are both "static website generators", which you can use as template libraries for websites that can be hosted freely via GitHub pages.
Both of these tools require some additional learning because they are deployed locally via the terminal, but they are a great resource for creating free, eye-catching websites.
If you wish to use your own domain name, you can purchase a domain for your GitHub pages site.
It is also possible to fork the website of someone else who has publicly hosted their website on GitHub in order to use it as a template.

### Making code citable

*Contributors to this section: Rob Crystal-Ornelas, Emma Hudgins, Dylan Gomes*  
GitHub makes it easy to store and share a variety of data files in the cloud. 
If a repository is made "public" the URL to the repository can be shared freely with others.
However, for a variety of reasons (e.g., privately owned company, ability to make repositories private, accounts can be deleted at will) GitHub is not considered a long-term data or code repository like [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and [figshare](https://figshare.com/) [@doi:10.1038/538127a; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947]. 
Also, unlike the long-term repositories, GitHub does not issue Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for content uploaded to their servers. 
DOIs are persistent and unique alpha-numeric IDs assigned to research products like papers, code, and data. 
DOIs allows tracking and citing research products. 
For this reason, scientists who share code and data through GitHub are strongly encouraged to also submit GitHub repository content to a long-term data archive [@doi:10.1029/2021EA001797]. 
Fortunately, both long-term repositories mentioned above (Zenodo and Figshare) have integrations with GitHub which facilitates archiving a snapshot of all repository content with the click of a button.  

Linking one's GitHub repository with Zenodo, etc. to achieve a DOI helps work become findable, gives proper attribution, and that can ensure long-term stability (Hampton et al. 2015). 
Thus, when researchers wish to include data and code with their publications, they ought to reference a DOI from a long-term storage site, rather than a URL from GitHub (which can change or be deleted). 
Additionally, referencing a DOI for data and code is preferable to submitting these as supplementary materials to the journal, as supplementary materials are more difficult to find and reuse (i.e. often not centralized and searchable in a database) and not necessarily permanent (as most journals offer no guarantee of long-term storage).

Many researchers believe that their code is not useful because their analysis is context-specific and not designed for re-use like software. 
However, there are many reasons to share data and code beyond re-use. 
Even if code is rough, it shows the exact steps taken to conduct an analysis, and therefore provides the most detailed look into how to reproduce a given analysis [@doi:10.1016/j.tree.2015.11.006]. 
This is important in light of the reproducibility crisis [https://doi.org/10.1038/533452a] and will become increasingly important to the collective scientific enterprise as advances in computing power and accessibility unlock the ability to conduct 'big data' meta research with data that has already been collected by others. 
Failing to include data and code with our publications leaves future scientists with many fewer resources from which to understand the world. 

The standard GitHub licensing options are best suited for software.
If your code is intended only for your specific analysis, consider a Creative Commons License.
The [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/non-software/) website can offer further guidance.
If you wish to allow anyone to re-use your code, consider a CC0 1.0 public domain dedication.
If you wish to receive attribution for any reuse of your code, consider a CC BY 4.0 license, which requires attribution upon reuse. 
If you have build an app, tool, package, or other product that you would like others to use and would like attribuion for any reuse of your code, consider the GNU General Public License v3. 
This license also prohibits the re-user from making their re-used version private.
If you do not wish to receive attribution and are open to private use, consider the MIT license.

### Collaborative (code) editing

*Contributors to this section: Kaitlyn Gaynor, Rob Crystal-Ornelas*

From its inception, one of the primary uses of GitHub has been for collaborative coding.
We acknowledge that there are important differences between the average software developer and ecology/evolution researcher using GitHub, and that not all GitHub collaboration features are optimal for research purposes.
However, core features of git like forking and branching can allow for simultaneous coding on different versions of the same research project, and alternative versions can be easily discussed and resolved with GitHub.
While a complete review of these features is beyond the scope of our paper, there are many free resources for learning how to use these collaborative features of GitHub [@10.1016/j.patter.2021.100206]. (e.g. <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request>)
It is often best to develop comfort with features like pull requests and merges on "practice" repositories with colleagues before integrating these tools fully into a collaborative workflow.

GitHub can also facilitate interactions between research advisors and advisees, providing a platform for students or other trainees to share in-progress code, and flag specific challenges or questions for their supervisors or mentors.
Periodic code review can also help advisors to identify errors early in the process, and inform further training and mentorship to fill gaps in skills.



### Writing manuscript

*contributors to this section:*\
Caveat that GitHub has been called out for not being so user-friendly for manuscript development (Ram 2013).
But getting better?
Tools that link with GitHub have been developed with synchronous writing in mind.
HackMD provides a collaborative writing platform based on Markdown that integrates with GitHub.\
We used this platform early on in the process of writing this manuscript to generate an outline.

### Peer-Review

<!--*contributors to this section:* Eric R. Scott-->

Peer review of research software by rOpenSci (<https://ropensci.org/software-review/>) and of research software and associated manuscripts by the Journal of Open Source Software (<https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html>) requires that submitted work is hosted on GitHub and their review processes make use of GitHub issues (Box 1).
<!--# not sure if links are really necessary -->GitHub can also be used as a hub for reviewers and authors during the peer review process of an ordinary research manuscript.
If the code associated with a manuscript is made available at the time of submission (e.g. via a link to a GitHub repository in a Data Availability Statement), peer-reviewers may be able to offer more helpful suggestions on written methods and may even make comments on the code itself, potentially catching bugs or errors before publication <!--# would be nice to have an example to link to here.  I suspect it is rare that reviewers look at code, but it's happened to me (ERS) -->.
GitHub issues (Box 1) can also be used to organize and discuss reviewer suggestions and to assign them to co-authors (See example [here](https://github.com/BrunaLab/HeliconiaDemography/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22reviewer+comment%22+)).
When reviewer comments are posted as separate issues, authors can comment on the issues to discuss possible changes and assign themselves to indicate which comments they intend to handle.
Co-authors can then integrate their edits and responses to reviewers using pull requests (Box 1).

### GitHub organizations

*Contributors to this section: Katherine Hébert, Cole Brookson*

Whether experiments are done in a wetlab, data are gathered in a field site, or analyses are run in a shared office, even conceptually distinct projects are often carried out in a common physical space. 
GitHub Organisations offer a shared virtual space that allows a team to work in different repositories, while remaining tied together under a larger figurehead, such as a laboratory, a department, an organisation, or a large project involving several teams. 
Organisations are well-suited to ensure larger projects with many steps or moving parts are constrained to one virtual space, where outputs and sub-projects can be easily accessed and located without relying on any one individual. 
Because the repositories are grouped in one virtual space, members can reference and contribute to each other's work without necessarily being part of the same repository, broadening the accessibility and longevity of code and writing contributions. 

Contributors can be assembled into teams within an organisation, which allows administrators to assign roles and tasks to groups of people. 
Whereas access to repositories is usually assigned to individual contributors, Organizations facilitate the management of access permissions by allowing each team to be granted access to certain repositories, and not to others. 
This ensures that more sensitive repositories remain as restricted as needed, while repositories with greater general interest can be easily accessible to many members at once.

As an example, GitHub Organizations are particularly well-suited to house documents and projects within a laboratory, such as research compendia, codes of conduct, protocols, training documents, and other such documents that evolve collaboratively over time and are relevant to many colleagues. 
In this way, students or teams can have full ownership of repositories within an organization, while ensuring that these materials stay accessible to the laboratory after people have moved on (or upgraded their computers). 
This application extends to research centres, which may include several distinct projects that remain linked under a given institution, such as the [German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv)](https://github.com/idiv-biodiversity).
Of course, the utility of this tool goes beyond laboratories - they are useful to structure the organisation, presentation, and outcomes of working groups such as the hackathon which inspired this paper ([SORTEE-Github-Hackathon](https://github.com/SORTEE-Github-Hackathon)) by keeping track of all materials as ideas develop and take shape in one virtual space.
Organisations are also convenient for hosting a set of related learning materials such as a set of lectures or workshops, such as the Québec Centre for Biodiversity Science R Workshop Series ([QCBSRworkshops](https://github.com/QCBSRworkshops)) or the University of Edinburgh's Coding Club ([Coding Club](https://github.com/ourcodingclub)), which may be updated by an ever-evolving group of contributors over time.

Utilizing GitHub organizations as a research group or even for a handful of individuals working on a group of projects can be incredibly useful for all involved. 
GitHub organizations are relatively easy to set up, and especially easy to manage as membership to the organization changes through time. 
Not only is it a useful way to store repositories of lab-related research products, but it's also incredibly helpful for storing "living documents" that may be edited frequently, and may be linked to a lab website (that could also be generated via a repository that lives within the organization!). 
The use of the "Teams" feature can allow certain groups to have varying levels of access to repos in the organization with a select group having push access to some repos but not others. 
This can manifest in a group working on some common dataset(s) (e.g. some genetic data) to have push access to the handful of repositories used for processing sequence data, while another group of students/researchers may have push access to an entirely different set of repos. 
The organization structure also allows for easy tracking of issues, projects, and discussions related to the research group, and provides PIs/group leads an easy birds-eye view of the progress going on across multiple projects.

As well, organizations provide a convenient location for students to archive the code for their projects, for use/reference by future students in the research group, thus providing a type of knowledge communication that may not exist otherwise. 
Indeed, providing new students with access to the organization and ideally a template repository for lab projects can soften the burden on those new to the software, in that it provides them with examples to work off of, and an online location to ask for help from their labmates and/or advisors through tools like projects, discussions, and issues.

### Additional uses for GitHub in EcoEvo research 
*Contributors to this section: RCO, Ali*  

There are many more ways that EEB researchers can use GitHub for accelerating research collaborations, and we briefly highlight several here.  
First, there are increasing calls for ecological data to be more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) [@doi:10.1016/j.tree.2019.04.005; @doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18].  
A key component of data reusability is standardizing the ways (e.g., variable names, file formats) that research data are archived in long-term repositories.  
Recently, community-led data standardization efforts are taking place on GitHub [@doi:10.1029/2021EA001797], where documents and templates can be version controlled and commented on by the user community [e.g., ESS-DIVE's GitHub Community Space](https://github.com/ess-dive-community).  

Ecologists who write code often use the R programming language, and the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) community has a well-established software peer review process that involves both rOpenSci's staff software engineers and the broader R user community.  
Their [software review GitHub repository](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/) provides instructions for submitting an R package for review as well as guidelines for code reviewers.  
rOpenSci's efforts have resulted in many well-used R packages for ecology research including rfishbase [@doi:10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03464.x] and taxize [@doi:10.12688/F1000RESEARCH.2-191.V2].  

Lastly, GitHub gists let users create and share snippets of code, notes, and files quickly.  
Rather than create an entire GitHub repository for saving a small code chunk you want to use in a presentation or share with a colleague, GitHub gists provide a lightweight way to write, save, and share code.  
Gists are associated with your Github account and can be public or private.  
Though gists lack all the features embedded in a GitHub repository, gists can still be forked, starred, downloaded, and easily added into a website or blog post.   





## Discussion

### General pargrah on what GitHub can enable in EcoEvo
General paragraph on GitHub on how, given all the potential uses of GitHub, it can enable more collaborative EcoEvo research
Despite all the awesomeness of GitHub, there are still plenty of times when you might look to other plantforms for collaboration

### Why aren't more people using GitHub?
Learning to use Github requires time, but the payoff is *[may be?]* worth it.
Time vs. effort examples or analyses to demonstrate the payoff can help drive the point home to convince people to learn these tools

### Limitations

*Contributors to this section: Ali*

Our own limitations since we are mostly writing from the EcoEvo perspective/ additional github limitation
Reliance on R since we are generally in EcoEvo
Discussion of free vs. paid plans. When projects get highly collaborative may have to add / pay for accounts. At this point, little difference between paid and free.

File size limitations make it hard to sync entire folders with the cloud, especially if your repo is private. 
One trick to increase the size limit associated with a repository is to attach additional large files to the release once the repository is finalized and ready for re-use.

While we have written this manuscript collaboratively via GitHub and GitHub Actions, there was a substantial learning curve, and we are all early career researchers who are highly motivated to learn these skills.
This approach is likely less practical when collaborating with people at later career stages and a greater range of computational skills.
Real-time collaboration via GitHub is also not possible without relying on additional tools such as hackmd, so there is a longer delay to receive feedback from other collaborators, and a greater likelihood of conflicts.

Lack of GitHub help documents for non-English researchers in ecology and evolution leads them to miss the opportunity to fully understand the importance version control as well as the other benefits of GitHub.

### Using GitHub is a good start, but lots of practices to make repo more user friendly


*Contributors to this section: Ali, Emma* 

Note: "Current tips copied from the "Figure_brainstorming_v2, 6th slide" from the Google Drive"
can be extended as much as we can. 
Later we decide the most important ones related the manuscript. 
All suggestions are welcome.

Tips:

1- Check for the solution to your problem on the Github Help [webpage](https://docs.github.com/en).
This site contains very extensive and detailed documents with helpful screenshots. 
It is useful for getting startet in general, but also has troubleshooting tips for specific problems.  

2- Consider taking free courses from [Software Carpentries](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) and sharing these courses with your lab members of colleagues.

3- See the repository for [this paper](https://github.com/SORTEE-Github-Hackathon/manuscript/) as an example of a collaborative manuscript that includes discussions, issues, and a website.

4- The GitHub [Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) allows you to learn GitHub basics through short projects and taks, and allows you to get feedback from their Learning Lab bot.

5- Check out the following [markdown cheatsheet](http://markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) so that you can write clear metadata README files for your repositories.

6- The Jenny Bryan universe of GitHub material provides a thorough and accessible introduction for a multitude of research-related uses for GitHub, and includes a [book](http://happygitwithr.com), [statistics course](http://stat545.com/) and [@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928].

7- Don't be afraid of trial and error. 
One of the best ways to learn Github is the trial and error method. 
Learning from the mistakes can be the best way to remember, and Github has the advantage of making it easy to go back to any steps that you desire via version controlling if you make mistakes. 

8- If you are an educator, include lectures on reproducibility and tools for creating reproducible workflows in your curricula. 
Some gradute programs now include coursework on course Rmarkdown and GitHub.
Getting students started with these tools earlier will prevent the resistance that comes from working with a less reproducible workflow for a longer period of time.

9- Consider Tweeting your issue. 
There is a large community of GitHub users around the world who have likely faced analogous problems and may be able to provide quick solutions. 

10- Other blogs? twitter accounts?
